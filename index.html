  </div>
  <p>
    <p>Professional Wrestler. Grandson of fellow wrestler Popeye Richards. Started wrestling at age 14 in the northeastern states. In 1990 he worked in the GWF and USWA promotions. In 1994 he had longtime girlfriend Tammy Sytch as his valet-manager and held the SMW tag title with Brian Lee in Tennessee. Later that year he beat Tracey Smothers in a tournament final for the NWA world title. He held that for three months losing to ultimate fighter Dan Severn. In 1995 he and Tammy appeared in WWF as the Body Donnas, Skip and Sunny. He was upset by longtime jobber Barry Horowitz. He then teamed with Rad Radford (Louis Spocoli). In 1996 he and Zip (Tom Prichard) held the WWF tag title. Later on Candido injured his neck. From there he wrestled in ECW but he and Tammy left the business due to drug problems. He returned to action in Australia in 1999 and then to WCW where he teamed with Bam Bam Bigelow (Scott Bigelow). He then broke his wrist. From there he wrestled in various areas and returned to NWA-TNA in 2005. During a tag match at the Lockdown pay per view in Orlando his leg was broken in two places when a dropkick delivered by Sonny Siaki landed awkwardly. Candido had surgery and appeared the next night as the manager of The Naturals. He returned home to New Jersey but died five days after the accident due to a blood clot at age 33.
